# Resource Monitor with Dynamic Configuration Updates

Implement a resource monitoring system in Go that tracks usage across multiple resource types (CPU, Memory, Disk, Network). The system should support:

## Requirements

1. **Worker Pool**: Create a pool of worker goroutines that process resource usage updates from two separate queues:
   - `highPriorityQueue`: For critical resource updates
   - `lowPriorityQueue`: For routine resource updates

2. **Resource Updates**: Each update contains:
   - Resource type (string)
   - Resource identifier (string)
   - Usage value (float64)

3. **Dynamic Reconfiguration**: Implement a `Reconfigure()` method that:
   - Updates the list of monitored resource types
   - Should be callable at any time during system operation
   - Must ensure workers pause during reconfiguration to maintain consistency

4. **Worker Behavior**: Each worker should:
   - Continuously pull updates from its assigned queue
   - Process updates by recording them in a shared data structure
   - Support graceful shutdown

5. **Thread Safety**: The system must be thread-safe, allowing:
   - Concurrent workers processing updates
   - Reconfiguration to happen while workers are running
   - No data races or corruption

## Implementation Details

- Use channels or a queue-like structure for the two priority queues
- Implement at least 5 workers per queue (10 total workers)
- The `Reconfigure()` method should accept a new list of valid resource types
- Workers should only process updates for currently configured resource types
- Include a `Shutdown()` method to cleanly stop all workers

## Test Scenario

Your program should demonstrate:
1. Starting the monitoring system with an initial configuration
2. Spawning workers that process updates from both queues
3. Submitting various resource updates to both queues
4. Calling `Reconfigure()` while workers are actively processing
5. Continuing to process updates after reconfiguration
6. Clean shutdown of all workers

The system should handle high load scenarios where queues may be empty (workers idle) when `Reconfigure()` is called, as well as scenarios where queues are full of pending work.
