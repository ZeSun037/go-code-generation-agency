# Cloud Zone Information Service

You are building a cloud provider service that needs to fetch and cache zone information (like availability zones and regions) for cloud instances.

## Requirements

Implement a Go program that simulates a cloud zone information service with the following specifications:

1. **Zone Information Structure**: Create a service that returns zone information containing:
   - A failure domain (e.g., "zone-1", "zone-2", etc.)
   - A region name (e.g., "us-west")

2. **Lazy Initialization**: The failure domain should be fetched from a simulated remote service only once (lazy initialization pattern) and then cached for subsequent calls.

3. **Remote Fetch Simulation**: Implement a function `fetchFailureDomain()` that:
   - Simulates a network call with a 100ms delay
   - Returns a failure domain string
   - Has a 30% chance of returning an error (simulate network failures)

4. **Concurrent Access**: The service must be safe for concurrent access. Multiple goroutines should be able to call `GetZone()` simultaneously.

5. **Test Program**: Create a main function that:
   - Launches 10 goroutines concurrently
   - Each goroutine calls `GetZone()` 3 times
   - Prints the results or errors
   - All goroutines should complete successfully within a reasonable time

## Expected Behavior

- The first successful call to `GetZone()` should fetch and cache the failure domain
- Subsequent calls should return the cached value immediately
- If the fetch fails, the error should be returned to the caller
- The program should handle concurrent calls gracefully without hanging or deadlocking
- All goroutines should complete their work

## Deliverable

Provide a complete, runnable Go program that implements this cloud zone information service.
