# Task Scheduling System with Caching

Implement a task scheduling system that determines whether tasks can be assigned to workers based on various predicates (rules). The system should support concurrent scheduling decisions and include a caching mechanism to optimize repeated predicate evaluations.

## Requirements

Your program should implement:

1. **Task Scheduler** that evaluates whether a task can be assigned to a worker based on multiple predicates.

2. **Predicate Functions** - Implement at least 3 different predicates that check:
   - Whether the worker has sufficient capacity for the task
   - Whether the worker has the required skills for the task
   - Whether the worker is in the correct location for the task

3. **Equivalence Cache** - A cache that stores predicate evaluation results to avoid redundant computations. The cache should:
   - Store results keyed by task name, worker name, and predicate name
   - Support cache invalidation when worker states change
   - Be thread-safe with Lock/Unlock methods
   - Have a method `GetCachedResult(taskName, workerName, predicateName string) (fit bool, reasons []string, valid bool)` that returns cached results if valid
   - Have a method `UpdateCache(taskName, workerName, predicateName string, fit bool, reasons []string)` to store new results

4. **Concurrent Scheduling** - The system should support evaluating multiple task-worker pairs concurrently using goroutines.

5. **Event Handlers** - Simulate background goroutines that periodically invalidate cache entries when worker states change (e.g., capacity updates, skill changes).

## Program Structure

- Create structs for `Task`, `Worker`, and `Cache`
- Implement predicate functions with signature: `func(task Task, worker Worker) (bool, []string, error)`
- Implement a `ScheduleTask` function that:
  - Iterates through all predicates in order
  - Uses the cache when available
  - Falls back to executing predicates when cache is invalid or unavailable
  - Updates the cache with new results
  - Returns whether the task fits and any failure reasons

## Test Scenario

Create a test scenario with:
- 5 workers with different capacities, skills, and locations
- 10 tasks with varying requirements
- Launch multiple goroutines to schedule tasks concurrently
- Run background goroutines that simulate worker state changes and cache invalidation
- Print scheduling results showing which tasks were assigned to which workers

The program should run for a few seconds demonstrating concurrent scheduling operations and proper cache usage.
