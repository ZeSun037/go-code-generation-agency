# Connection Pool Manager

Implement a connection pool manager in Go that handles establishing connections to backend servers through a load balancer.

## Requirements

Your program should implement the following components:

1. **LoadBalancer**: A component that provides server addresses through a notification channel
   - Has a `Notify()` method that returns a read-only channel of address lists
   - Can be closed, which closes the notification channel

2. **ConnectionPool**: Manages connections to backend servers
   - Has a `Start(doneSignal chan struct{})` method that:
     - Listens for address updates from the load balancer
     - Attempts to establish connections to the provided addresses
     - Closes the `doneSignal` channel after the first successful connection
   - The `doneSignal` parameter may be `nil` (in which case, no signal is needed)

3. **Main program** that demonstrates:
   - Creating a connection pool with a load balancer
   - Starting the connection pool with a done signal channel
   - Simulating a scenario where the load balancer closes before any addresses are provided
   - Verifying that the done signal is properly handled with a timeout

## Specifications

- The load balancer should send address lists through its notification channel
- Addresses can be represented as simple strings (e.g., "server1:8080")
- Connection attempts can be simulated (don't need real network connections)
- The program should include a test case that:
  - Creates a connection pool
  - Starts it with a done signal channel
  - Closes the load balancer immediately (before sending any addresses)
  - Waits up to 200ms for the done signal
  - Reports success or failure based on whether the signal was received

## Example Output

Your program should print status messages and indicate whether the test passed or failed:

```
Starting connection pool...
Load balancer closed
Test PASSED: done signal received
```

or

```
Starting connection pool...
Load balancer closed
Test FAILED: done signal not received within timeout
```
