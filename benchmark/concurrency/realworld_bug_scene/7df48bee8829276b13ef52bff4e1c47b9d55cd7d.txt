# Programming Problem: Stream Manager with Concurrent Readers

Implement a stream management system that handles multiple concurrent data streams. The system should support creating streams, reading from them, and properly closing them even when there are in-flight read operations.

## Requirements

Your task is to implement a `StreamManager` that manages multiple data streams with the following specifications:

### Core Components

1. **StreamManager**: Manages a collection of active streams
   - `NewStream(id int) (*Stream, error)`: Creates and registers a new stream with the given ID
   - `CloseStream(id int, err error)`: Closes a stream and removes it from active streams
   - `Shutdown()`: Closes all active streams

2. **Stream**: Represents an individual data stream
   - `Read() (string, error)`: Blocks until data is available or the stream is closed with an error
   - `Write(data string)`: Writes data to the stream (for testing purposes)

### Behavior Requirements

- Multiple goroutines should be able to call `Read()` on the same stream concurrently
- When `CloseStream()` is called with an error, all in-flight `Read()` operations must receive that error and unblock
- `Read()` should block if no data is available and the stream hasn't been closed
- Once a stream is closed, it should be removed from the manager's active streams
- The system should handle the case where `Read()` is called while `CloseStream()` is being executed

### Test Scenario

Your program should demonstrate the following scenario:

1. Create a stream
2. Start multiple goroutines that call `Read()` on the stream (simulating in-flight operations)
3. Close the stream with a specific error
4. Verify that all `Read()` operations receive the error and complete within a reasonable timeout (e.g., 2 seconds)
5. Print success or failure messages

### Expected Output

The program should print messages indicating:
- When streams are created
- When read operations start
- When read operations complete (with success or error)
- When streams are closed
- Overall test result (PASS/FAIL)

### Example Structure

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "time"
)

type Stream struct {
    // Your implementation
}

type StreamManager struct {
    // Your implementation
}

func main() {
    // Demonstrate the concurrent stream closing scenario
}
```

Ensure your implementation properly handles the concurrency challenges of closing streams while read operations are in progress.
