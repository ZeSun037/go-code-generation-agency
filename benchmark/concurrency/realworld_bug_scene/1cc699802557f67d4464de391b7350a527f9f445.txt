# Distributed Node Manager

Implement a distributed node manager system in Go that handles peer connections and graceful shutdown.

## Requirements

Your system should implement a `NodeManager` that:

1. **Manages outgoing connections** to peer nodes in a distributed system
2. **Runs two background goroutines**:
   - A `bootstrap` goroutine that periodically discovers and connects to seed nodes
   - A `manage` goroutine that maintains connections to peer nodes

3. **Bootstrap goroutine** should:
   - Run in a loop with a 5-second interval between iterations
   - Acquire a lock to check if the manager is closed
   - If closed, exit the loop
   - Otherwise, simulate discovering and connecting to bootstrap nodes (you can just print a message)

4. **Manage goroutine** should:
   - Run in a loop with a 3-second interval between iterations
   - Acquire a lock to check the manager's state
   - Simulate managing peer connections (you can just print a message)
   - Exit when the manager is closed AND there are no more outgoing connections

5. **Shutdown method** should:
   - Mark the manager as closed
   - Wait for both goroutines to complete before returning

6. **Main function** should:
   - Create a NodeManager
   - Start both background goroutines
   - Let them run for 10 seconds
   - Call shutdown and wait for clean termination
   - Print "Shutdown complete" when done

## Implementation Notes

- Use a mutex to protect shared state (closed flag and connection count)
- Use a WaitGroup or channels to coordinate goroutine completion
- Simulate the connection count decreasing over time in the manage goroutine
- The program should complete without hanging or deadlocking

## Expected Behavior

The program should start both goroutines, let them run for a period, then shut down cleanly without any goroutines blocking indefinitely.
