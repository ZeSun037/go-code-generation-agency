# Distributed Task Coordinator Status Query

Implement a distributed task coordinator system in Go that manages worker nodes and allows querying their status.

## Requirements

Your system should include:

1. **TaskCoordinator**: A coordinator that manages task execution and maintains state
   - Should have a `Start()` method that begins processing
   - Should have a `Stop()` method that gracefully shuts down the coordinator
   - Should have a `Status()` method that returns the current state (number of tasks processed, current status string, etc.)
   - Should process tasks from an internal queue in a background goroutine

2. **Status Information**: The `Status()` method should return a struct containing:
   - `TasksProcessed`: number of tasks completed
   - `IsRunning`: whether the coordinator is currently active
   - `CurrentState`: a string describing the current state

3. **Task Processing**: 
   - The coordinator should simulate processing tasks in its event loop
   - Tasks can be simple counters that increment an internal counter
   - Processing should happen continuously while the coordinator is running

4. **Main Program**: 
   - Create a coordinator and start it
   - Launch multiple goroutines (at least 3) that periodically call `Status()` to query the coordinator's state
   - After a short time, stop the coordinator
   - Continue calling `Status()` from the goroutines even after the coordinator has stopped
   - Print the status information from each query
   - Ensure the program completes within a reasonable time (e.g., 5 seconds total)

## Expected Behavior

- Status queries should work correctly while the coordinator is running
- Status queries should work correctly (and not hang) after the coordinator is stopped
- The program should terminate cleanly without deadlocks
- All goroutines should be able to complete their status queries

## Example Output Structure

```
Goroutine 1: Status{TasksProcessed: 42, IsRunning: true, CurrentState: "processing"}
Goroutine 2: Status{TasksProcessed: 45, IsRunning: true, CurrentState: "processing"}
Coordinator stopped
Goroutine 1: Status{TasksProcessed: 50, IsRunning: false, CurrentState: "stopped"}
Goroutine 3: Status{TasksProcessed: 50, IsRunning: false, CurrentState: "stopped"}
Program completed successfully
```
