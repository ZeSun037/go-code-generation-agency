# Event Distribution System

Implement a concurrent event distribution system in Go that allows multiple watchers to subscribe to and receive events from a central multiplexer (Mux).

## Requirements

Your system should support the following functionality:

1. **Mux (Multiplexer)**: A central component that:
   - Accepts events through a `Broadcast(event Event)` method
   - Distributes events to all active watchers
   - Allows creating new watchers through a `Watch()` method
   - Manages watcher lifecycle

2. **Watcher Interface**: Each watcher should:
   - Provide a `ResultChan()` method that returns a read-only channel for receiving events
   - Provide a `Stop()` method to unsubscribe from the Mux
   - Be safe to stop multiple times

3. **Event**: A simple struct containing:
   - `Type` (string): the event type
   - `Data` (interface{}): arbitrary event data

## Implementation Details

- The Mux should maintain a collection of active watchers
- When an event is broadcast, it should be sent to all currently active watchers
- Watchers should be able to stop receiving events at any time
- The system must handle concurrent operations safely (multiple goroutines creating watchers, broadcasting events, and stopping watchers simultaneously)

## Test Scenario

Your program should demonstrate:
1. Creating a Mux
2. Starting multiple watchers (at least 3)
3. Broadcasting several events
4. Having some watchers stop while events are being broadcast
5. Continuing to broadcast events after some watchers have stopped
6. Properly cleaning up all resources

Print received events from each watcher to demonstrate the system is working correctly.

## Expected Behavior

- All active watchers should receive all events broadcast while they are active
- Stopped watchers should not receive new events
- The system should not hang or deadlock under normal operation
- Stopping a watcher multiple times should be safe
