# Key-Value Proxy Service

Implement a key-value proxy service in Go that manages client connections and provides a clean shutdown mechanism.

## Requirements

Your task is to create a key-value proxy service with the following components:

### 1. Cache Component
Create a simple cache structure that:
- Stores key-value pairs in memory
- Has a `Close()` method that cleans up resources
- Prints a message when closed

### 2. Client Component
Create a client structure that:
- Has a context that can be cancelled
- Provides a `Context()` method to access its context
- Has a `Close()` method that cancels its context

### 3. Proxy Component
Create a proxy structure that:
- Wraps a client and cache
- Has a constructor function `NewKVProxy(client)` that returns:
  - The proxy instance
  - A "done" channel that signals when the proxy is ready to be closed
- Provides basic key-value operations (Get/Put)

### 4. Main Program
Write a main program that:
- Creates multiple proxy instances (at least 3)
- Performs some operations on each proxy
- Closes all clients
- Waits for all proxies to complete cleanup
- Reports whether any goroutines were leaked

### Success Criteria
- The program should create and close multiple proxy instances
- All resources should be properly cleaned up
- The program should complete execution within 2 seconds
- Print the number of active goroutines at the start and end of the program
- The program should not hang or leak goroutines

### Example Output Structure
```
Starting goroutines: X
Created proxy 1
Created proxy 2
Created proxy 3
Performing operations...
Closing clients...
Waiting for cleanup...
Ending goroutines: Y
Program completed successfully
```

Implement this service paying careful attention to goroutine lifecycle management and proper cleanup of resources.
