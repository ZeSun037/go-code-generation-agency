# Token Manager with Expiration

Implement a concurrent token management system in Go that handles user authentication tokens with automatic expiration.

## Requirements

Your system should support the following operations that may be called concurrently from multiple goroutines:

1. **CreateToken(username string) string** - Generate and store a new token for a user. The token should be a random string and should expire after 5 seconds.

2. **RefreshToken(token string) bool** - Reset the expiration time of an existing token to 5 seconds from now. Returns true if the token exists, false otherwise.

3. **ValidateToken(token string) (string, bool)** - Check if a token is valid and return the associated username. If valid, also refresh its expiration time. Returns the username and true if valid, empty string and false otherwise.

4. **RevokeUser(username string)** - Immediately invalidate all tokens belonging to a specific user.

5. **Shutdown()** - Clean up all resources and stop background operations.

## Implementation Details

- Tokens should automatically expire and be removed 5 seconds after creation or last refresh
- A background goroutine should check for expired tokens every 100 milliseconds
- The system must be safe for concurrent access from multiple goroutines
- Token strings can be simple random alphanumeric strings of length 16

## Test Program

Your program should include a `main()` function that demonstrates:
- Creating tokens for multiple users concurrently
- Validating tokens from multiple goroutines
- Revoking a user's tokens while other operations are in progress
- Verifying that tokens expire after the timeout period
- Proper shutdown of the system

The test should run for at least 10 seconds and demonstrate that all operations work correctly under concurrent access without deadlocks or race conditions.
