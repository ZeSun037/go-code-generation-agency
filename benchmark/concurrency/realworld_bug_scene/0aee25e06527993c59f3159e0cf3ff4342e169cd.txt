# Distributed Task Scheduler

Implement a distributed task scheduler in Go that manages and executes tasks across multiple workers.

## Requirements

Your program should implement a task scheduler with the following components:

### 1. Task Structure
- Each task has a unique ID and a function to execute
- Tasks should be able to run concurrently
- Tasks may take varying amounts of time to complete

### 2. Scheduler
Implement a `Scheduler` that:
- Accepts new tasks for execution
- Maintains a pool of worker goroutines (configurable size, e.g., 5 workers)
- Distributes tasks to available workers
- Provides a method to stop the scheduler gracefully
- Provides a method to get the count of currently running tasks

### 3. Worker Pool
- Workers should continuously process tasks from a queue
- Each worker runs in its own goroutine
- Workers should handle task execution and report completion

### 4. Main Program
Create a main program that:
- Initializes a scheduler with a fixed number of workers
- Submits at least 20 tasks with simulated work (e.g., sleep for random durations between 100ms-500ms)
- Prints when each task starts and completes
- Stops the scheduler after all tasks are submitted
- Waits for all tasks to complete before exiting
- Runs the entire workflow at least 3 times in a loop to demonstrate stability

### 5. Expected Behavior
- The program should run without hanging
- All submitted tasks should complete
- The program should exit cleanly after all iterations
- No goroutines should be left running after the program completes

## Example Output Format
```
Starting iteration 1
Task 1 started
Task 2 started
Task 1 completed
Task 3 started
...
Iteration 1 complete
Starting iteration 2
...
All iterations complete
```

Implement this scheduler ensuring proper resource management and clean shutdown behavior.
