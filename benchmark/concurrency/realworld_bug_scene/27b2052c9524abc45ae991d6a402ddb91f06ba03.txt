# Round-Robin Load Balancer

Implement a round-robin load balancer in Go that distributes requests across multiple backend servers. The load balancer should support dynamic updates to the list of available servers.

## Requirements

1. **LoadBalancer Interface**: Create a load balancer that can:
   - Start monitoring a list of backend server addresses
   - Distribute incoming requests in a round-robin fashion across available servers
   - Handle dynamic updates to the server list
   - Gracefully shut down

2. **Server Address Updates**: Implement an address watcher that:
   - Runs in a separate goroutine
   - Periodically fetches updated server addresses from a resolver
   - Notifies the load balancer of address changes

3. **Request Handling**: The load balancer should:
   - Accept incoming requests
   - Select the next server using round-robin algorithm
   - Return the selected server address

4. **Concurrency**: The implementation must be thread-safe and handle:
   - Multiple concurrent requests
   - Address updates happening while requests are being processed
   - Proper cleanup on shutdown

## Implementation Details

Your program should include:

- A `RoundRobinBalancer` struct with methods:
  - `Start()`: Initialize and start the address watcher
  - `Next()`: Return the next server address in round-robin order
  - `Close()`: Stop the balancer and clean up resources

- An address resolver that simulates fetching server addresses (you can use a simple function that returns mock addresses)

- A demonstration in `main()` that:
  - Creates a load balancer
  - Starts it with an initial set of servers
  - Simulates concurrent requests (at least 10 goroutines making requests)
  - Simulates address updates during operation (at least 2-3 updates)
  - Properly shuts down the balancer

## Expected Output

Your program should print:
- Which server is selected for each request
- When address updates occur
- Confirmation of graceful shutdown

The program should run without hanging or panicking, and should complete within a reasonable time (a few seconds).
