# Plugin Manager Initialization

You are building a plugin management system that needs to initialize multiple plugins concurrently. Each plugin requires some setup work that can be done in parallel to speed up the startup process.

## Task

Implement a `PluginManager` that can initialize multiple plugins concurrently and wait for all of them to complete before proceeding.

## Requirements

1. Create a `Plugin` struct that represents a plugin with:
   - A `Name` field (string)
   - An `Initialize()` method that simulates initialization work (sleep for a random duration between 100-500ms and print a message)

2. Create a `PluginManager` struct that:
   - Maintains a list of plugins
   - Has an `AddPlugin(plugin Plugin)` method to register plugins
   - Has an `InitializeAll()` method that:
     - Initializes all plugins concurrently (each in its own goroutine)
     - Waits for all plugins to finish initialization
     - Returns an error if any plugin fails to initialize
     - Prints "All plugins initialized successfully" when complete

3. In your `main()` function:
   - Create a `PluginManager`
   - Add at least 5 plugins with different names
   - Call `InitializeAll()`
   - Print the total time taken for initialization

## Example Output

```
Initializing plugin: plugin-1
Initializing plugin: plugin-3
Initializing plugin: plugin-2
Initializing plugin: plugin-4
Initializing plugin: plugin-5
Plugin plugin-3 initialized
Plugin plugin-1 initialized
Plugin plugin-5 initialized
Plugin plugin-2 initialized
Plugin plugin-4 initialized
All plugins initialized successfully
Total initialization time: 523ms
```

## Notes

- Use proper concurrency primitives to coordinate the goroutines
- Ensure the program doesn't exit before all plugins are initialized
- The initialization order may vary due to concurrent execution
