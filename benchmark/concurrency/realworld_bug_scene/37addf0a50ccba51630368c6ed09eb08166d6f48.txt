# Container Network Manager

Implement a container network manager system in Go that handles connecting and disconnecting containers from networks. The system needs to support concurrent operations while maintaining container state persistence.

## Requirements

Your program should implement the following:

1. **Container Structure**: Create a container type that has:
   - A unique ID
   - A list of connected networks
   - A state that needs to be checkpointed/saved
   - Thread-safe access methods

2. **Network Manager (Daemon)**: Implement a daemon/manager that:
   - Manages multiple containers
   - Provides `ConnectToNetwork(containerID, networkName)` method
   - Provides `DisconnectFromNetwork(containerID, networkName)` method
   - Persists container state after network operations

3. **State Persistence**: Implement a `CheckpointTo(storage)` method that:
   - Saves the current container state to a storage backend (can be simulated with a map or file)
   - Takes a noticeable amount of time (simulate with a small sleep)

4. **Concurrent Operations**: The program should:
   - Support multiple goroutines performing network operations on different containers simultaneously
   - Support multiple goroutines performing network operations on the same container
   - Ensure thread-safety for all container operations

5. **Demonstration**: Create a main function that:
   - Initializes several containers
   - Spawns multiple goroutines that concurrently:
     - Connect containers to various networks
     - Disconnect containers from networks
     - Perform these operations on the same containers from different goroutines
   - Waits for all operations to complete
   - Prints success message if all operations complete without hanging

## Example Usage Pattern

```go
daemon := NewDaemon()
container := daemon.CreateContainer("container1")

// These should be able to run concurrently
go daemon.ConnectToNetwork("container1", "network1")
go daemon.ConnectToNetwork("container1", "network2")
go daemon.DisconnectFromNetwork("container1", "network1")
```

Your implementation should handle at least 20-30 concurrent operations across 3-5 containers without deadlocking or data races. Use proper synchronization primitives to ensure correctness.
