# Device Manager Programming Problem

Implement a concurrent device management system in Go that handles virtual storage devices. The system should support creating, mounting, unmounting, and deleting devices with proper concurrency control.

## Requirements

Your system should implement the following operations:

1. **AddDevice(deviceID, parentID string)**: Create a new device based on a parent device (snapshot-like behavior)
2. **DeleteDevice(deviceID string)**: Remove a device from the system
3. **MountDevice(deviceID, mountPath string)**: Mount a device to a specific path
4. **UnmountDevice(deviceID string)**: Unmount a device
5. **GetDeviceStatus(deviceID string)**: Get the current status of a device (mounted/unmounted, mount count, etc.)

## Specifications

- The system maintains a collection of devices, each identified by a unique string ID
- There should be a "base" device (ID: "base") that serves as the root parent
- Each device can be mounted multiple times (reference counting), but always to the same path
- Devices have states: created, mounted, unmounted
- The system must be safe for concurrent access from multiple goroutines
- Device operations may take time (simulate with sleep for mount/unmount operations)
- A device cannot be deleted while it's mounted

## Implementation Details

- Use appropriate synchronization primitives (mutexes, etc.)
- Each device should track:
  - Device ID
  - Parent device ID
  - Mount path (if mounted)
  - Mount count (reference counter)
  - Active state
- The global device collection needs protection
- Individual device state modifications need protection

## Test Scenario

Your program should demonstrate the following concurrent scenario working correctly:

```
1. Create device "dev1" from "base"
2. In goroutine A: Mount "dev1", sleep for 2 seconds, then unmount
3. In goroutine B (started after 500ms): Try to get status of "dev1"
4. In goroutine C (started after 500ms): Try to mount "dev1" to same path
5. After all operations complete: Delete "dev1"
```

All operations should complete without deadlocks, and the program should print the sequence of operations as they occur.

## Expected Output Format

Print each operation with timestamps, such as:
```
[Time] Goroutine X: AddDevice dev1 with parent base - Success
[Time] Goroutine Y: MountDevice dev1 at /mnt/dev1 - Success
[Time] Goroutine Z: GetDeviceStatus dev1 - Success (mounted, count: 1)
...
```

The program should exit cleanly after all operations complete.
