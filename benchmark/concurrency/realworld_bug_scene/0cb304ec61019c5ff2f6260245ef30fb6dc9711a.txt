# Distributed Log Replayer

You are building a distributed log system that needs to replay entries from a write-ahead log (WAL) during startup and then continue processing new entries during normal operation.

## Requirements

Implement a log replayer system with the following components:

1. **LogEntry** structure with:
   - `Index`: a monotonically increasing uint64 identifier
   - `Type`: either "normal" or "config"
   - `Data`: string content

2. **Replayer** that:
   - Has a `commitC` channel that outputs processed log entries to clients
   - Has a `stopC` channel to signal shutdown
   - Loads historical entries from storage during initialization
   - Processes entries in order by index
   - Continues to accept and process new entries after replay completes

3. **Behavior**:
   - During startup, replay all historical entries from storage
   - After replay completes, send a `nil` signal on `commitC` to indicate replay is finished and the system is ready for live operations
   - After the nil signal, continue processing new incoming entries
   - Both replayed and new entries should be sent to `commitC` in order
   - Handle graceful shutdown via `stopC`

## Implementation Task

Write a Go program that:

1. Simulates a storage system with 5 historical log entries (indices 1-5)
2. Creates a Replayer that loads and processes these historical entries
3. After replay, submits 3 new entries (indices 6-8) for processing
4. A client goroutine reads from `commitC` and prints:
   - Each entry's index and data
   - A special message when it receives the nil signal indicating replay completion
5. Demonstrates proper shutdown

## Example Output

```
Replaying entry 1: historical data 1
Replaying entry 2: historical data 2
Replaying entry 3: historical data 3
Replaying entry 4: historical data 4
Replaying entry 5: historical data 5
--- Replay complete, system ready ---
Processing entry 6: new data 1
Processing entry 7: new data 2
Processing entry 8: new data 3
Shutdown complete
```

The system should handle the coordination between replay completion and live processing without deadlocks or race conditions.
