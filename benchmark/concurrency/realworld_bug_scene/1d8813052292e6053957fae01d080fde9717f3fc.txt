# Distributed Key-Value Store Client

Implement a simplified key-value store client that supports concurrent `Get` operations and client `Close` operations.

## Requirements

Your task is to implement a `KVClient` that can:

1. **Get(key string) (string, error)**: Retrieve a value for a given key from a remote store
2. **Close() error**: Close the client and clean up resources

## Specifications

### Client Structure
- The client maintains a connection to a remote service
- Multiple goroutines may call `Get` concurrently
- Any goroutine may call `Close` at any time
- The client should use proper synchronization to manage the connection state

### Behavior Requirements

1. **Get Operation**:
   - Should acquire access to the connection
   - Should return an error `ErrConnectionClosed` if the client has been closed
   - Should simulate a remote call (you can use `time.Sleep` to simulate network delay)
   - For simplicity, you can return mock data or an empty string for successful gets

2. **Close Operation**:
   - Should mark the client as closed
   - Should prevent new `Get` operations from proceeding
   - Should clean up the connection
   - Should return `nil` on success

3. **Concurrency**:
   - `Get` and `Close` may be called concurrently from different goroutines
   - The program must not deadlock when `Close` is called while `Get` operations are in progress
   - All operations should complete within a reasonable time (< 3 seconds)

### Test Program

Your program should include a `main` function that:
1. Creates a client
2. Launches a goroutine that calls `Get` 
3. Immediately (or after a small delay) calls `Close` from the main goroutine
4. Verifies that both operations complete without deadlock within 3 seconds
5. Prints "SUCCESS" if the test passes, or "FAILURE" if it times out or deadlocks

## Example Output

```
Starting test...
Get operation completed with error: connection closed
Close operation completed
Test completed in time
SUCCESS
```

Your implementation should handle the race condition between `Get` and `Close` operations correctly to avoid deadlocks.
