Implement a memory-mapped database system in Go that supports transactional access with two transaction types: multiple concurrent read-only transactions that capture database metadata at creation time, and a single read-write transaction that can modify the database file structure and size. All transactions must be tracked in an active transaction list and properly cleaned up upon completion.
The database file should be accessed via mmap, allowing the entire file to be mapped to memory for read-write operations. When write transactions expand the file, the system must perform a remap operation that waits for all transactions using the old mapped region to complete before updating to the new region. This remap process must not cause deadlocks or prevent system progress, and new transactions created after remap should use the updated mapped region.
Manage database metadata using two meta pages that store information like page size and free space. Each transaction reads meta information at startup. The system must support meta initialization, updates on read-write transaction commits, and maintain meta consistency across remap and expansion operations.
