# Distributed Lock Manager Programming Problem

Implement a distributed lock manager system in Go that allows multiple clients to acquire and release locks on named resources. The system should support the following requirements:

## Requirements

1. **Lock Acquisition**: Clients should be able to request a lock on a named resource (e.g., "resource-1"). If the lock is already held by another client, the requesting client should wait in a queue until the lock becomes available.

2. **Session Management**: Each client should have a session with a unique session ID (you can use a simple counter or UUID). Sessions should persist across multiple lock operations.

3. **Lock Release**: Clients should be able to explicitly release locks they hold.

4. **Fair Queuing**: Locks should be granted in the order they were requested (FIFO).

5. **Multiple Clients**: The system should handle multiple concurrent clients attempting to acquire locks on the same or different resources.

## Implementation Details

Your program should:

- Create a lock manager that can handle multiple named locks
- Simulate at least 5 concurrent clients attempting to acquire the same lock
- Each client should:
  - Create a session
  - Attempt to acquire a lock
  - Hold the lock briefly (simulate work with a small sleep)
  - Release the lock
- Demonstrate that only one client holds the lock at any given time
- Print output showing which client acquires and releases the lock, in order

## Test Scenario

Include a test scenario where:
1. Multiple clients compete for the same lock
2. Verify that locks are acquired in order
3. Verify mutual exclusion (only one client holds the lock at a time)
4. Bonus: Simulate a scenario where the same session attempts to acquire the same lock multiple times

## Expected Output

Your program should produce output demonstrating:
- The order in which clients request locks
- The order in which clients acquire locks
- That mutual exclusion is maintained
- That all clients eventually acquire and release the lock

You may use channels, mutexes, and goroutines to implement this system. The focus should be on correctness of the concurrent lock management logic.
