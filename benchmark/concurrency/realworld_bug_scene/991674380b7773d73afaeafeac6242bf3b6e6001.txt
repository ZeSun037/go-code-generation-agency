# Resource Watcher with Periodic Sync

Implement a resource watcher system in Go that monitors changes to a collection of resources and periodically resyncs them.

## Requirements

Create a `ResourceWatcher` that:

1. **Watches resources**: Continuously monitors a simulated resource stream (you can simulate this with a channel that occasionally sends resource updates)

2. **Periodic resyncing**: Every 5 seconds, performs a full resync operation that reconciles the local state with the source

3. **Error handling**: The watch operation may fail randomly (simulate this). When it fails, the `WatchAndSync` method should return an error

4. **Graceful shutdown**: Accepts a stop channel that, when closed, should cleanly shut down all operations

5. **Multiple cycles**: The `WatchAndSync` method should be callable multiple times (simulating retries after errors)

## Implementation Details

Your program should include:

- A `ResourceWatcher` struct with a `WatchAndSync(stopCh <-chan struct{}) error` method
- A `Resync()` function that simulates reconciliation work (just print a message and sleep briefly)
- A simulated resource stream that occasionally sends updates
- Random errors in the watch loop (e.g., 20% chance of error every few seconds)
- A main function that:
  - Creates a ResourceWatcher
  - Calls `WatchAndSync` in a loop with retry logic
  - Demonstrates proper cleanup when the program is interrupted (use signal handling)

## Expected Behavior

- The resync operation should occur every 5 seconds while watching
- When `WatchAndSync` returns (due to error), all background operations should stop
- When the stop channel is closed, everything should shut down cleanly
- The program should be able to restart watching after an error without leaking resources

## Example Output

```
Starting watch cycle 1...
Received resource update: item-1
Performing resync...
Received resource update: item-2
Performing resync...
Watch error occurred: simulated failure
Starting watch cycle 2...
Performing resync...
Received resource update: item-3
Shutdown signal received
Cleaning up...
