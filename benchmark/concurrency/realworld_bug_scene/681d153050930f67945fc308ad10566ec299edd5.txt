# Cluster Status Monitor

You are building a distributed system that monitors the status of multiple clusters. Your system needs to track whether all clusters are synchronized and ready to serve requests.

## Requirements

Implement a cluster monitoring system with the following components:

### 1. Cluster Structure
- Each cluster has a name and a controller that tracks its sync status
- The controller has a `HasSynced()` method that returns whether the cluster has completed its initial synchronization

### 2. ClusterMonitor
Implement a `ClusterMonitor` that:
- Maintains a registry of clusters (identified by name)
- Allows adding new clusters dynamically via `AddCluster(name string, controller Controller)`
- Allows removing clusters via `RemoveCluster(name string)`
- Provides a method `AreClustersSynced(clusterNames []string) bool` that checks if:
  - All specified clusters exist in the registry
  - The number of clusters in the registry matches the number of specified clusters
  - All specified clusters report as synced via their controller's `HasSynced()` method

### 3. Controller Interface
```go
type Controller interface {
    HasSynced() bool
}
```

### 4. Concurrent Access
Your implementation must be **thread-safe** and support:
- Concurrent calls to `AddCluster` and `RemoveCluster`
- Concurrent calls to `AreClustersSynced` while clusters are being added/removed
- Concurrent calls to `AreClustersSynced` from multiple goroutines

## Test Scenario

Your program should demonstrate:
1. Creating a monitor with several clusters
2. Multiple goroutines concurrently checking if clusters are synced
3. Concurrent addition and removal of clusters
4. The system correctly reporting sync status without hanging or racing

Simulate controllers that take varying amounts of time to sync (e.g., 10-100ms). Run at least 100 concurrent operations to verify correctness.

## Success Criteria

- The program runs to completion without deadlocks
- All sync status checks return correct results
- No race conditions (verify with `go run -race`)
