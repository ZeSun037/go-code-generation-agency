# Lease Information Fetcher

Implement a concurrent lease information fetcher service in Go. The service should fetch lease details from a remote endpoint and handle potential errors gracefully.

## Requirements

Your task is to implement a function `FetchLeaseInfo` that:

1. Takes a context, a lease ID (integer), and a URL (string) as parameters
2. Makes an HTTP GET request to fetch lease information in a separate goroutine
3. Returns the response body as a byte slice and any error that occurred
4. Properly handles both HTTP request errors and response reading errors

## Specifications

- The function signature should be: `func FetchLeaseInfo(ctx context.Context, leaseID int, url string) ([]byte, error)`
- Launch a goroutine to perform the HTTP request
- The goroutine should:
  - Create and execute an HTTP GET request to the provided URL
  - If the request fails, report the error
  - If the request succeeds, read the response body
  - If reading the body fails, report that error as well
  - Close the response body when done
- The main function should wait for either:
  - The goroutine to complete (successfully or with error)
  - The context to be cancelled
- Return appropriate results based on which condition occurs first

## Test Scenarios

Your implementation should handle:
1. Successful HTTP requests that return valid data
2. Failed HTTP requests (network errors, invalid URLs, etc.)
3. Successful requests but failed body reads
4. Context cancellation before the request completes

## Notes

- Use the standard `net/http` package
- Ensure your implementation doesn't leak goroutines
- Consider what happens if the caller doesn't wait for your goroutine to complete
- Think about channel operations and blocking behavior

Provide a complete, runnable Go program with the implementation and a `main` function that demonstrates at least two different scenarios.
