# Progress Tracker System

Implement a concurrent progress tracking system in Go that monitors the progress of multiple download tasks.

## Requirements

Create a program that simulates downloading multiple files concurrently and tracks their progress. Your implementation should include:

1. **Download Simulator**: A function that simulates downloading a file by:
   - Taking a file ID and a total size
   - Incrementing progress from 0 to the total size
   - Sending progress updates through a channel
   - Each progress update should include the file ID and current progress value

2. **Progress Monitor**: A function that:
   - Receives progress updates from multiple concurrent downloads
   - Tracks the latest progress for each file ID
   - Validates that progress values are monotonically increasing for each file
   - Prints the final progress state for all files

3. **Main Program**: 
   - Start at least 3 concurrent download simulations with different file IDs
   - Each download should have at least 100 progress increments
   - Collect and validate all progress updates
   - Ensure the program completes without deadlocks

## Specifications

- Use channels to communicate progress updates between goroutines
- Each progress update should be a struct containing:
  - `ID`: string identifier for the file
  - `Current`: current progress value
  - `Total`: total size (optional)
  
- The progress monitor should verify that for each file ID, the progress values it receives are always increasing (or equal)

- The program should handle the completion of all downloads gracefully and exit cleanly

## Example Output

```
Starting downloads...
File A: progress 50/100
File B: progress 75/100
File C: progress 30/100
...
All downloads completed successfully
Final state:
  File A: 100/100
  File B: 100/100
  File C: 100/100
```

Your solution should demonstrate proper concurrent programming practices and handle synchronization correctly.
