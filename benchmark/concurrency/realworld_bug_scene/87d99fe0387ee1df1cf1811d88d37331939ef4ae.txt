# Distributed Election Coordinator

Implement a distributed election coordinator system in Go that simulates multiple clients competing for leadership.

## Requirements

Your program should:

1. Create multiple clients (at least 3) that compete for leadership in rounds
2. Each client should:
   - Attempt to become a leader through a campaign process
   - If elected as leader, perform validation work
   - Observe and track who the current leader is
   - Signal when ready for the next round
   - Release leadership and prepare for the next election round

3. Implement a coordinator that:
   - Manages multiple rounds of elections (configurable, e.g., 5 rounds)
   - Tracks progress across all clients
   - Ensures all clients complete each round before moving to the next
   - Reports statistics at the end (e.g., how many times each client became leader)

4. Each client should run concurrently in its own goroutine

5. The election process for each round should include:
   - A campaign phase where one client becomes the leader
   - A validation phase where the leader performs some work
   - A release phase where leadership is given up
   - Synchronization to ensure all clients are ready before starting the next round

6. Use channels to coordinate between:
   - Clients signaling they're ready for the next round
   - Leader notifying followers of state changes
   - Tracking completion of rounds

## Implementation Details

- Simulate the campaign process (you can use random selection, first-come-first-served, or any deterministic method)
- The leader should perform some simulated work during validation (e.g., sleep for a short duration)
- Followers should wait appropriately for the leader to complete its work
- Use proper synchronization primitives (channels, mutexes, etc.) to coordinate between goroutines
- The program should complete all rounds without hanging or deadlocking
- Print progress information showing which client is the leader in each round

## Output

Your program should print:
- Which client becomes leader in each round
- Progress through rounds
- Final statistics of leadership distribution
- The program should exit cleanly after all rounds complete
