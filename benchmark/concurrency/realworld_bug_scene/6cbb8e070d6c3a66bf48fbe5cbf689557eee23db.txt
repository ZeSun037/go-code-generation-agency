# UDP Proxy Server

Implement a UDP proxy server in Go that forwards packets between clients and a backend server. The proxy should maintain connection tracking to ensure packets from the same client are consistently forwarded through the same connection to the backend.

## Requirements

1. **Proxy Setup**: Create a UDP proxy that listens on a frontend address and forwards traffic to a backend address.

2. **Connection Tracking**: Maintain a connection tracking table that maps client addresses to their corresponding backend connections. This ensures that packets from the same client reuse the same backend connection.

3. **Bidirectional Forwarding**: 
   - Forward packets from clients to the backend server
   - Forward response packets from the backend server back to the appropriate clients

4. **Concurrent Operation**: Handle multiple clients simultaneously, with each client's packets being processed concurrently.

5. **Error Handling**: Handle cases where:
   - The backend server might be unreachable
   - Dial operations to the backend might fail
   - Read/write operations might encounter errors

## Implementation Details

- Use a map to track active connections between clients and the backend
- Protect the connection tracking table with appropriate synchronization mechanisms
- When a packet arrives from a new client, establish a new connection to the backend
- When a packet arrives from an existing client, reuse the existing backend connection
- Launch a goroutine for each client connection to handle backend-to-client forwarding

## Test Scenario

Your implementation should be testable with:
- A simple UDP echo server as the backend
- Multiple concurrent clients sending packets
- Scenarios where the backend is temporarily unavailable or unreachable

## Expected Behavior

The proxy should continue operating even when individual dial attempts fail, allowing subsequent packets (from the same or different clients) to be processed normally.
