# Concurrent Stream Manager

Implement a concurrent stream manager that handles multiple data streams over a network connection. The manager should support writing data to streams and gracefully closing the connection.

## Requirements

Your program should implement a `StreamManager` with the following functionality:

1. **Stream Writing**: Support concurrent writes to a stream through a `Write(streamID int, data []byte) error` method. Each write should send a message to an internal channel for processing.

2. **Stream Reset Handling**: Maintain a reset channel that receives notifications when streams need to be reset or closed. The channel should have a buffer size of 10.

3. **Connection Closure**: Implement a `Close() error` method that:
   - Stops accepting new writes
   - Closes the reset channel
   - Cleans up all resources

4. **Background Processing**: Run a background goroutine that:
   - Processes messages from the reset channel
   - Handles a shutdown signal to stop processing
   - Properly synchronizes access to shared resources

5. **Concurrent Safety**: The implementation must be safe for concurrent use by multiple goroutines.

## Implementation Details

- Use appropriate synchronization primitives (mutexes, channels, etc.)
- The `Write` method should acquire a lock before sending to the reset channel
- Simulate stream resets by having some writes trigger reset notifications
- Create a test scenario with at least 20 concurrent goroutines performing writes
- Some goroutines should call `Close()` while others are still writing

## Test Scenario

Your `main` function should:
1. Create a `StreamManager`
2. Launch 20+ goroutines that continuously write data to various streams
3. After a short delay, call `Close()` from another goroutine
4. Ensure the program completes without hanging or panicking
5. Print status messages showing successful completion

The program should run for a few seconds and then exit cleanly, demonstrating that all goroutines have properly terminated.
